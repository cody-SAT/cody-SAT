    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Cody ðŸ‘‹. My greatest strengths as a teacher are being patient and fitting myself to the student's learning style rather than forcing them to fit to mine. I enjoy tutoring because I like seeing others do well, especially at something as important as education.</p>
      <p>The best piece of advice I can give on the English section is that on the surface two or three of the answers may sound fine, but the test is designed to have only one 100% correct and defensible answer. Top scorers are able to hit 800s or near-800s back-to-back, which proves the test isnâ€™t a guessing game. I find that students read more critically and score much higher with this idea in mind.</p>
      <p>Math is simpler: if a student can recall Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II at an A+ level on the same day, they will score very close to perfect. The challenge is remembering three years of math and working carefully under time pressure. To address this, we streamline problem-solving into clear, repeatable steps to reduce mistakes and maximize efficiency.</p>

    <!-- Best Times -->
    <section id="timing">
      <h2>Best Times to Study for the SAT (Ranked)</h2>
      <p>Summers are the ideal time to take the SAT because the student does not have to worry about coursework and extracurriculars.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Summer prior to Junior year -</strong> The Math section covers up to Algebra II. If the student waits until Senior year, they may forget and have to relearn old concepts. Reading speed, comprehension, vocabulary, etc. will typically only marginally improve from Junior to Senior year, so studying earlier is worthwhile, as it gives the student more chances to take the test and less pressure as a result. Additionally, this timeline leaves the following Summer fully dedicated to college application preparations.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer prior to Senior year -</strong> The student has learned the most concepts in school by this point and still has 5 chances to take the test.</li>
        <li><strong>Senior Fall -</strong> Senior year grades are weighed much less in admissions than other years and may not be reviewed for early decision applicants, so Senior Fall is generally better than Junior year.</li>
        <li><strong>Junior year (worst) -</strong> The worst time to study for the SAT is during Junior year. Any time studying for the SAT would be better spent focusing on school, unless the student has a really easy schedule.</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Resources -->
    <section id="resources">
      <h2>Resources I Use When Tutoring</h2>
      <h3>Core Materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prefix, root word, and suffix lists for vocabulary building</li>
        <li>Vocabulary drawn from previous SAT tests</li>
        <li>Key grammar rules and usage patterns</li>
        <li>Full-length Digital Practice Tests in Bluebook (best simulation of the official digital interface)</li>
        <li>Seven official paper full-length practice tests from the College Board</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Magoosh or Khan Academy</h3>
      <p>Depending on the studentâ€™s preference, I incorporate either platform for structured practice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Magoosh SAT:</strong> Tracks pace, allows question flagging for review, and provides a score predictor that has been reliable in my experience. Subscription typically costs $90â€“$130 (one-time, year-long access). (No affiliation.)</li>
        <li><strong>Khan Academy:</strong> Free, with high-quality videos and adaptive practice aligned to official SAT skills; many students use this successfully.</li>
